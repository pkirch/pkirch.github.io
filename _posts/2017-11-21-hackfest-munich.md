On October 24th and 25th we had an IoT and App Services Hackfest at the Microsoft Office in Munich-Schwabing.

While supporting for Logic Apps in Azure App Services I learned about the three following topics.

1) How to handle data type issues of data from Azure Storage blobs.

    For that topic I have written a separate blog post:  
    [How to handle data type issues of data from Azure Storage blobs](2017-11-25-logic-apps-data-type-issues.md)

2) How to create Azure Function apps in Visual Studio to be viewable in the Logic App Designer in the Azure Portal.
3) How to create a custom Logic App connector.
